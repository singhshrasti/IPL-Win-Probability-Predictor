A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the **win probability** of an IPL team during a live match based on current match conditions.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The IPL Win Probability Predictor uses historical IPL match data and a trained ML model to estimate the chances of a team winning at any given point in the match.  
Users can input match details like runs, overs, wickets, target score, and teams to get real-time predictions through a **Streamlit web interface**.
